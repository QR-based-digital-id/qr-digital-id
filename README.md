# QR-Based Campus Management System

## Project Overview
The QR-Based Campus Management System is a centralized digital platform designed to manage campus entry/exit, attendance tracking, and institutional access services using a single static QR code for each student throughout their academic tenure.

The system replaces manual record-keeping with a secure, automated QR-based verification mechanism that improves efficiency, reduces waiting time at entry points, and enables real-time monitoring of campus activities.


---

## Objectives
- Provide secure digital identification using QR codes
- Automate attendance and campus entry/exit logging
- Reduce manual workload for guards and faculty
- Enable centralized monitoring and reporting
- Improve operational efficiency within campus infrastructure

---

## Key Features
- Single QR-based digital ID for entire student tenure
- Automated QR validation and identity verification
- Entry/Exit logging with timestamps
- Course-wise attendance management
- Role-based access control (Student, Guard, Faculty, Admin)
- Anti-passback system to prevent QR misuse
- Manual override functionality for guards (fallback)
- Reporting and administrative dashboards
- Graduation-based QR invalidation and database archival

---

## System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture with:
- Centralized backend database
- Web-based user interface
- QR scanning modules
- Role-based service layers
